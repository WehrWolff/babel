# myLang

My own programming language which doesn't have a name yet. It currently is referred to as myLang, this name will change in the future.

myLang is a custom programming language inspired by C and C++. The main goal of this project is to create a fast, easy-to-use programming language that is accessible to programmers of all experience levels.

## Overview

At its core, myLang is designed to be fast and efficient, utilizing the principles of both C and C++ to create a robust and high-performing language. With the inclusion of classes, myLang aims to provide a level of abstraction and modularity that allows for more organized and manageable code.

## Goals

The end goal of myLang is to create a programming language that incorporates the speed and efficiency of a compiled language, while maintaining the simplicity and user-friendliness of interpreted languages. This makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from low-level systems programming to high-level application development.

## Features

- **Fast**: myLang is designed to be compiled, allowing it to run as fast as the machine code of the host machine.
- **Easy to use**: Inspired by Python, myLang aims to be easy to learn and use, regardless of the programmer's experience level.
- **Class Support**: myLang supports classes, allowing for object-oriented programming and making the code more organized and manageable.

## Future Plans

While myLang is currently in its development phase, plans for the future include more features and enhancements aimed at increasing the language's versatility and usability. Stay tuned for updates and feel free to contribute to the development process.
